# application entity

part of the ITS station reference architecture (3.1.9.4) that is
            responsible for providing ITS-related functionality

NOTE: Within the US, the National Transportation Communications for
            ITS Protocol (NTCIP) standards identify an "information layer" on top of the traditional
            OSI stack. However, the purpose of this layer includes both information configuration
            and functionality. The ITS-S reference architecture separates these two roles between
            the management entity (3.1.5.6) and the application entity.
