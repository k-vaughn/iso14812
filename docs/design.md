# design

the process or the result of the process to define the architecture, system
            elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system element

NOTE: Design provides the detailed implementation-level physical
            structure, behaviour, temporal relationships, and other attributes of system elements.
            It is information including specification of system elements and their relationships,
            that is sufficiently complete to support a compliant implementation of the architecture,

EXAMPLE: Example: Complete documentation for building a specific model of a smartphone
