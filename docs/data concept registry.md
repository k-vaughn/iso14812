# data concept registry

electronic data dictionary (3.1.10.3) that follows precise documented rules
            for the registration and management of stored data concepts (3.1.10.1)

NOTE: The data concept registry contains meta-attributes (3.1.10.2)
            about data concepts in terms of their names and representational forms as well as the
            semantics associated with the data concepts. A data concept registry may contain
            metadata that assists information interchange and re-use, both from the perspective of
            human users and for machine-interpretation of data concepts.
