# class

set of ideas, abstractions or things in the real world that are identified
            with explicit boundaries and meaning and whose properties and behaviour follow the same
            rules

NOTE: Some ISO/TC 204 documents use the term "object class" for
            consistency with ISO 11179-1, but within ITS, the term "class" is more generally
            understood.
