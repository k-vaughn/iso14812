# public

type of financial model (3.5.8.1) where services (3.5.1.1) are provided by
            an administrative authority in an attempt to better serve societal interests

NOTE: The transport service (3.5.2.1) is typically offered to the
            transport consumer for less than the full capital and operating cost of providing the
            service, but this is not a requirement.
