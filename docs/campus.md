# campus

jurisdictional area (3.4.3.4) with a jurisdictional entity (3.4.3.6) who is
            the owner of the area but excluding transport facilities managed by the local government

NOTE: A campus can be privately or publicly owned.

EXAMPLE: A point of interest (e.g., airport, university, business park,
            industrial area, shopping centre) that manages its own transport infrastructure
            separately from that managed by the local government. In this case, the point of
            interest and its own transport system are a part of the campus.
