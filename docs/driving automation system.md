# driving automation system

hardware and software system (3.1.2.1) that is able to perform part or all
            of the DDT (3.7.3.1) on a sustained basis

NOTE: In contrast to this generic term for any level 1-5 system, the
            specific term for a level 3-5 system is "Automated Driving System (ADS)." Given the
            similarity between the generic term, "driving automation system," and the level
            3-5-specific term, "Automated Driving System," the latter term is intentionally
            capitalized when spelled out and reduced to its acronym, "ADS", as much as possible,
            while "driving automation system" should not be.
