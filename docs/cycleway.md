# cycleway

infrastructure primarily designed for the use of cycles and separate from a
            carriageway (3.3.1.5)

NOTE: Local legislation can allow cycleways to be used by a variety of
            low-speed vehicles (3.7.5.2) (e.g. low-speed scooters, skateboards, etc.) and can share
            usage of other low-speed modes such as pedestrians (3.6.1.4), horseback riders, etc.
