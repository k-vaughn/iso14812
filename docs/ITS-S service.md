# ITS-S service

communication functionality of an ITS station (3.2.7.3) that provides the
            capability to connect to other nodes

NOTE: The definition of ITS-S service predates the adoption of the
            concept model used for the other service terms in this standard. It is an outlier in
            that it describes a portion of the functionality contained within the ITS station
            reference architecture (i.e., the communication functionality) rather than the end
            functionality of the conceptual ITS station.
