# driving space

area above the roadway (3.3.1.3) that is primarily designed for the
            movement of vehicles (3.7.1.1)

NOTE: In practice, the driving space design considers a variety of
            issues, which can result in suboptimal road (3.3.5.1) segments that violate normal
            design guidelines. Such locations (3.4.1.1) are typically posted with warning signs, but
            they are still designed for the movement of vehicles.
