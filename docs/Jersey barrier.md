# Jersey barrier

physical traffic separator (3.3.2.1) that consists of a wall with a wide,
            sloped base designed to divert vehicles (3.7.1.1) back into their traffic lane
            (3.3.1.13)

NOTE: Jersey barriers are typically modular. They are typically made
            of concrete but can also be made with other materials such as plastic filled with water
            or sand.
