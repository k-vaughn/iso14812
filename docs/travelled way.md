# travelled way

part of the roadway (3.3.1.3) that is currently intended for transport
            purposes

NOTE: The travelled way does not include hard shoulders (3.3.1.19),
            hardstanding (3.3.1.17), or other areas that are not currently intended for normal
            operational use. In other words, while these other areas are "designed" for transport
            purposes, they are not "intended" for normal transport purposes (at present); rather
            these extra areas exist for safety and other exceptional use conditions.
