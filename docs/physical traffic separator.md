# physical traffic separator

mechanism used to physically separate a travelled way or pathway from the
            adjacent environment

NOTE: Mechanisms include various types of barriers, such as walls,
            rails, pylons, kerbs and ditches, as well as open, unpaved space. If two streams of
            traffic are only separated by paved space (including any markings and rumble strips),
            they share a common carriageway.
