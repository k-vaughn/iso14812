# ADS-equipped vehicle

vehicle (3.7.1.1) integrated with an ADS (3.7.3.10)

NOTE: The terms "automated vehicle" and "AV" are often used in a
            colloquial form. However, these terms can be used to mean either an "ADS-equipped
            vehicle" or a "vehicle with an engaged ADS". The term "ADS-equipped vehicle" is
            preferred since it is more precise and descriptive in its meaning.
