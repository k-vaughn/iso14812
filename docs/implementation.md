# implementation

the process or the result of the process of translating a design into
            hardware components, software components, or both

NOTE: An implementation is the conceptual set of all instances of a
            product resulting from the translation. The set of all instances can consist of a single
            instance.

EXAMPLE: Example: The process of building a specific model of a smartphone or the
            resultant model of smartphone
