# ITS-S communication unit

physical unit in an ITS-S unit (3.2.7.4) containing part or all of the
            functionality of the ITS-S (3.2.7.3)

NOTE: In case an ITS-SU consists of a single physical unit, the ITS-SU
            and the ITS-SCU are identical. In case an ITS-SU consists of more than one ITS-SCU, then
            these ITS-SCUs are interconnected via the ITS station-internal network of the ITS-SU.
