# ITS on-board equipment

vehicle system (3.2.1.5) that provides all ITS functionality on-board the
            vehicle (3.7.1.1)

NOTE: ITS on-board equipment relates to any functionality. When there
            is a need to distinguish between core functionality and that by a special vehicle, the
            term can be further refined by indicating the type of vehicle to which the on-board
            equipment relates. For example, emergency vehicle on-board equipment can provide
            specialized functionality.
