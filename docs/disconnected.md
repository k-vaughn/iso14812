# disconnected

characteristic of a material entity (3.1.1.3) that is or was equipped with
            communications equipment that is sufficiently physically disconnected such that the
            material entity is no longer able to send data to or receive data from connected
            (3.2.3.6) entities

NOTE: The vehicle on-board equipment can still be present in the
            vehicle (3.7.1.1) and can even be partially connected, but not in any operational sense.
