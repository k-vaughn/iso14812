# road vehicle

vehicle (3.7.1.1) meeting the requirements to operate within the driving
            space (3.3.1.4) of a road (3.3.5.1)

NOTE: Unless indicated otherwise, the term typically refers to
            vehicles that are allowed to operate in the same driving spaces as motorized passenger
            (3.6.2.1) cars, according to the legal requirements of the local jurisdictional entity
            (3.1.1.1). However, the term can be contextualized for other environments (3.1.3.11).
            For example, a bicycle is a "road vehicle" when the "road" is a cycleway (3.3.3.2).
