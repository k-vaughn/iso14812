Clause: 3.5.6.2

Note 1 to entry: A shared transport service might not be dependent upon a vehicle and/or could be multi-modal. For example, a letter courier service could rely on walking and [public transport](public transport.md).

Note 2 to entry: Responsibilities of the transport service can be further delegated to others. For example, a courier service relying on public transport would delegate the operation of the transport mode to the public transport operator.

History note: Introduced in ISO/TS 14812:2022
