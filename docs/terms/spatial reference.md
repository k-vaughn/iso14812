| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [dynamic spatial reference](dynamic spatial reference.md) | [spatial reference](spatial reference.md) generated on-the-fly based on geographic properties in a digital map database |
| [link location](link location.md) | [pre-coded spatial reference](pre-coded spatial reference.md) defined within the [road network](road network.md) database |
| [pre-coded spatial reference](pre-coded spatial reference.md) | [spatial reference](spatial reference.md) using a unique identifier that is agreed upon in both the sender and receiver [system](system.md) to select a [location](location.md) from a set of pre-coded locations |
