# shared transport service

transport service (3.5.2.1) that relies upon the same resources (3.1.6.2)
            to fulfil the transport needs (3.5.2.4) of multiple unrelated transport users (3.5.2.3)
            and where the transport provider (3.5.2.2) has the primary responsibility for the
            operation of the transport mode

NOTE: A shared transport service might not be dependent upon a vehicle
            and/or could be multi-modal. For example, a letter courier service could rely on walking
            and public transport (3.5.6.1).
