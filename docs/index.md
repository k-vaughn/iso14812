# ITS Vocabulary

A vocabulary defined for Intelligent Transport Systems and documented as a formal
ontology. The contents of this vocabulary are periodically standardized in ISO 14812,
whereas this file is maintained through a [GitHub
project](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/iso14812).

The original version of the vocabulary was published as [ISO/TS
14812:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/79779.html). [Edition
2](https://www.iso.org/standard/85041.html) was released in 2025.

With edition 3, the draft standard is now generated from this ontology file, originally
developed in 2026.


The formal definition of the terms is available in [OWL Syntax](itsVocabulary.owl).
