# ISO 14812 _Intelligent Transport Systems - Vocabulary_

This repository is provided to promote the collaborative development of terminology for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) community. The work is led by ISO/TC 204/WG 1, but we are interested in receiving input from the full ITS community so that the end result is a resource that will be widely used and accepted.

The contents of this vocabulary are periodically standardized in ISO 14812, whereas this [GitHub project](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/iso14812) is used for maintenance and adding new terms as well as a history of changes.

The original version of the vocabulary was published as [ISO/TS 14812:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/79779.html). [Edition 2](https://www.iso.org/standard/85041.html) was released in 2025.

With edition 3, the draft standard is now generated from this ontology file, originally developed in 2026. 

The process used by this effort conforms to ISO 704:2009, which defines the following process for each concept (i.e., meaning of a term) that you wish to define:

1. Analyse the intension (i.e., characteristics) and extension (i.e., resulting set of objects) of the concept
2. Determine the concept's relationships to other concepts
3. Illustrate the relationships with a concept diagram
4. Formulate definitions based on the relationships
5. Assign a designation (i.e., the term) to each concept in the diagram

The process used by this effort also conforms to ISO 24156-1:2014, which defines how to use UML to illustrate relationships with a concept diagram (Step 3 above).
